I'm currently working on a new version with the new ESP32-S3, here is a picture of my current prototype (shell and buttons are resin printed for now).

PCBway sent me free PCBs for prototyping, a huge thanks to them!
Check out their website if you need cheap (and high quality) PCB prototyping.

They spend more time checking your design files to avoid errors compared to JLCPCB!

The quality of the soldermask is incredible (in my opinion way better than the matte finish from JLCPCB).
PCBway also does multicolor silkscreen wich I haven't tried personally...for now!
