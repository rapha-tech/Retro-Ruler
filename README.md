## Specs:
<pre>
- battery : 210 mAh -> 2h battery life
- MCU : ESP32-S3 8MB ram 16MB flash
- USB-C : charge (TP4054) and program
- Micro SD : store games
- 12 buttons for input (1 for ON/OFF) + 2 shoulders
- 1.69 inch IPS screen with round corners
- 0.7W speaker
- NS4168 IÂ²S DAC + Amplifier
</pre>

Older prototype (fully assembled) shell and buttons were resin printed.

PCBway sent me free PCBs for prototyping, a huge thanks to them!
Check out their website if you need cheap (and high quality) PCB prototyping.

They spend more time checking your design files to avoid errors compared to JLCPCB!

The quality of the soldermask is incredible (in my opinion way better than the matte finish from JLCPCB).
PCBway also does multicolor silkscreen wich I haven't tried personally...for now!
